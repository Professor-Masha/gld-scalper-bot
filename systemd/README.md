# Linux Service Definitions

systemd templates for supervised server operation.

Return to the [project manual](../README.md).

## Folder Contract

- Keep runtime code deterministic and testable; Ollama and research jobs may not call broker-order methods.
- Never commit credentials, `.env`, SQLite databases, raw quotes/trades, CSV exports, or downloaded training data.
- Preserve paper, historical, and future live state separation.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes, and update this guide when file ownership changes.

## Files In This Folder

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [`gld-scalper.service`](../systemd/gld-scalper.service) | systemd service unit template. |

## Linkage And Change Discipline

1. Start at the composition root in `src/gld_scalper/main.py` or the invoking tool/script.
2. Follow typed settings from `config.py`; environment values should not be read ad hoc elsewhere.
3. Follow persistence through `database.py` and `schema.sql`; multi-row execution state must remain transactional.
4. Follow behavioral evidence into the matching tests before changing a public interface.
5. Run focused tests first, then the complete suite. Paper execution is the final verification stage, not the first.

## Data And Security

Tracked code and promoted model memory may be committed. Raw market data, account data, exports, logs, API keys, and local Ollama model blobs stay outside Git. Model artifacts must retain their checksum, manifest, training range, exact feature profile, metrics, and rollback lineage.
